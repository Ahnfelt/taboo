The level editor is where you create and modify levels.

# Creating walls #

You create walls by placing and connecting wall joints. Click anywhere on the map to place a wall joint. A small solid dark circle within it will reveal that the joint is selected. Now hold Control while clicking somewhere else to create a wall. At the end of the wall there will be a new point, and it will be selected. You can create more walls from there.

You can select a joint you already placed by clicking on it. You can delete a wall joint and all the walls connected to it by pressing Delete.

# Other tips #

There is an invisible grid that the mouse cursor sticks to by default. If you hold Alt, you will be able to move the cursor freely.

To view the level without editor hints, hold Shift and Control.
